## About Me

I am currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan, supersived by Dr. Henry Liu. I received my Ph.D. degree in Civil Engineering and Scientific Computing at University of Michigan in 2023 and my Bachelor's degree in School of Vehicle and Mobility at Tsinghua University. My research interests include traffic flow model, traffic control & operations, particularly with big data and connected & automated transportation. My research works are founded on a variety of methodologies including applied statistics, network science, machine learning, and optimization. My work on optimizing traffic signals with connected vehicle data has been covered by media including [UofM news](https://news.umich.edu/improving-traffic-signal-timing-with-a-handful-of-connected-vehicles/), [AP news](https://apnews.com/article/smarter-traffic-signals-north-carolina-michigan-757d6151e85565e9656d7b95c6e72490), and [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/google-green-light-traffic-light-optimization-992e4252). I am honored to have received the 2024 INFORMS TSL Best Dissertation Award and to be a finalist for the IEEE ITSS Best Dissertation Award.
