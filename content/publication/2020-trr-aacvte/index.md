abstract: Ann Arbor Connected Vehicle Test Environment (AACVTE) is the world’s largest operational, real-world deployment of connected vehicles (CVs) and connected infrastructure, with over 2,500 vehicles and 74 infrastructure sites, including intersections, midblocks, and highway ramps. The AACVTE generates a massive amount of data on a scale not seen in the traditional transportation systems, which provides a unique opportunity for developing a wide range of connected vehicle (CV) applications. This paper introduces a data infrastructure that processes the CV data and provides interfaces to support real-time or near real-time CV applications. There are three major components of the data infrastructure - data receiving, data pre-processing, and visualization including the performance measurements generation. The data processing algorithms include signal phasing and timing (SPaT) data compression, lane phase mapping identification, trajectory data map matching, and global positioning system (GPS) coordinates conversion. Simple performance measures are derived from the processed data, including the time–space diagram, vehicle delay, and observed queue length. Finally, a web-based interface is designed to visualize the data. A list of potential CV applications including traffic state estimation, traffic control, and safety, which can be built on this connected data infrastructure is discussed.
